# CodeSignal GCA – 16-Day Prep Plan (Working 6am–3pm)

This plan is optimized for:
- 16 days total
- ~1.5–2 hours on weekdays
- ~3–4 hours on weekends
- Rusty algorithm practice
- Goal score: 650–720 (competitive, realistic)

This is an exam-prep plan, not an engineering mastery plan.

---

## Mental Model Reset

- You do NOT need to solve the hard problem to score well.
- You DO need to solve the first 2–3 problems cleanly and quickly.
- Speed + correctness > elegance.
- This is a standardized test, not real-world engineering.

Target consistency, not perfection.

---

## Language Choice

**Python only.**

Reasons:
- Minimal syntax
- Fast iteration
- Easier debugging under pressure

Do not optimize for “impressiveness.” Optimize for speed and reliability.

---

## What the GCA Actually Tests

1. Translating problem statements into logic quickly
2. Correct use of arrays, strings, and hash maps
3. Reading and respecting constraints
4. Staying composed when code fails

It does NOT test advanced CS theory.

## High-Yield Topic List

### Tier 1 (Highest ROI)
- Arrays
- Strings
- Hash maps / sets
- Counting / frequency
- Simple greedy logic

### Tier 2 (Often appears as a medium)
- Sliding window
- Two pointers
- Prefix sums
- BFS / DFS (graphs or grids)

### Tier 3 (Hard problem territory)
- Basic dynamic programming
- Graph shortest path variants

Do NOT spend time on:
- Advanced math
- Segment trees
- Bit manipulation tricks
- Exotic DP optimizations

---

## 16-Day Prep Schedule

### Days 1–2: Warm-Up & Format Lock-In
**Goal:** Remove rust and rebuild confidence.

**Daily (~1.5–2 hrs):**
- 3–4 easy problems
- Focus on arrays, strings, hash maps

No strict timing yet. Focus on correctness and flow.

---

### Days 3–7: Core Medium Grind (Most Important Phase)
**Goal:** Become reliable on medium problems.

**Weekdays (~2 hrs):**
- Primary Exposure (1 hr)
    - 2 medium problems per day
    - Hard cap: 30 minutes per problem
    - If stuck at 20 minutes → read solution and move on
- Consolodation (1 hr)
    - 
Focus on:
- Clean logic
- Edge cases
- Understanding why the solution works

Avoid:
- Memorization
- Premature optimization

---

### Days 8–9: First Timed Mock
**Goal:** Experience real test pressure early.

- One full 70-minute mock
- Webcam on
- No phone
- No browser
- No music

Post-mock review:
- Identify failure type:
  - Logic error
  - Edge case miss
  - Time management
  - Panic/freeze

This is diagnostic, not judgmental.

---

### Days 10–13: Patch Weak Spots & Increase Speed
**Goal:** Eliminate predictable mistakes.

**Weekdays:**
- 1 easy (≤10 minutes)
- 2 medium (20–25 minutes each)

If weak in DP or graphs:
- Practice only basic patterns
- Goal is recognition, not mastery

---

### Day 14: Second Timed Mock
**Goal:** Confirm improvement.

Same rules as the first mock.

You should feel:
- Faster on Q1 and Q2
- Less panic
- Better decision-making on when to move on

---

### Day 15: Light Review Only
**Goal:** Avoid burnout.

- Review common patterns
- Re-read constraint handling notes
- Solve 1 easy problem only

No grinding.

---

### Day 16: Test Day

**Before the test:**
- 1 easy warm-up problem (10 minutes max)
- Stop coding at least 30 minutes before start

**During the test:**
- Q1: ≤10 minutes
- Q2 & Q3: primary focus
- Q4: attempt only if time remains

Do not emotionally commit to the hard problem.

---

## Scoring Reality

- First 2 solved cleanly + partial 3rd → ~650
- First 3 solved cleanly → ~700+
- Hard problem fully solved → bonus, not required

Most low scores come from mismanagement, not lack of knowledge.

---

## Debugging Rule (Non-Negotiable)

When code fails:
1. Check constraints and input size assumptions
2. Test empty and minimal cases
3. Print intermediate values
4. Fix ONE thing
5. Re-submit

No rewrites. No spirals.

---

## Final Reminder

You are not behind.
You are not expected to be elite.
You are expected to be composed and consistent.

This test rewards:
- Discipline
- Pattern recognition
- Emotional control

Treat it like an exam. Execute the plan.
